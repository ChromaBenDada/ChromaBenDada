- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChromaBenDada. Tokyo creative director in commercial design and production.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI tools that can help with creative projects, video production, audio production, and art creation.  I am currently struggling to get High Resolution Depth Maps working with Automatic 1111 on Colab.
- 🌱 I am an advanced creator, but a beginner at technical things. A lifetime Mac user. Midjourney early adopter. Supplementing my learning with ChatGPT and desparate searching.
- 💞️ I might collaborate with cat-related projects. :)
- 📫 Message me here if you like.
